# Car_Price_Predictor

Aim: The main aim of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the price of a car based on its features.

Some packages are:

•pandas •sklearn •seaborn •datetime •xgboost •joblib

→ Used tkinter for GUI
  ⁕ This project  include 'GUI' , that is an easy-to-use application that lets you determine an car's market worth depending on its attributes.
  
    To produce an accurate price estimate, it makes use of a trained machine learning model to examine a number of variables, including present price, kilometres driven, fuel 
    type, seller type, transmission, owner, and age. 





→ Description :
⁕ What this project does? 
 • The model uses machine learning techniques to find the most important features that influence automobile pricing. It is trained using a dataset of car prices and their 
   associated features. When the model is finished, it can be used to help people buy, sell, or value cars in an informed manner.
